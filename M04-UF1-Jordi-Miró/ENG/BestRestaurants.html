                            <p>Located in the Eixample, just in front of the Ninot Market, the establishment also surprises for its design. Respect for the history and heritage of the Mediterranean are what inspired the decoration and ceramics is the common thread that marks the interior space. The entrance area is inspired by Barcelona, by the slabs of the Ninot Market and the colors of the Mironian ceramics. The central corridor, made of ceramics with the colors and texture of argila, crosses the kitchen, which is completely visible to the customer, and leads to the main dining room, which is inspired by small fishing villages and stands out as a space that winks at Compartir.

                                In short, a surprisingly Mediterranean local, with a close and welcoming treatment, and with a creative cuisine designed to enjoy.

                            <p>Atomix is one of Manhattan's most desired dining rooms. Secreted away in a Murray Hill brownstone, the room unfolds into a chic bar and a subterranean dining counter sporting dark stone, soothing earth tones and views of the kitchen's inner works.
                                Chef Junghyun Park and his wife Ellia head a team that continues to push the boundaries of modern Korean cooking.  Dishes are delicate, yet satisfying and display extraordinary finesse. Mastery of technique and depth of flavor are seen in the likes of three-day salt-and-nuruk-cured kohlrabi, and rich Japanese butterfish dabbed with XO sauce and served in a froth of white kimchi sauce. The finale perfectly suits the meal, as in rice ice cream set atop Japanese castella and dressed with malted barley syrup and crushed honeycomb candy.

                                After it was postponed last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, this Tuesday several gourmet specialists, critics, analysts, chefs and writers gathered in Antwerp, Belgium to announce the list of the 50 best restaurants in the world.
